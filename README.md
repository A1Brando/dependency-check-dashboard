A comprehensive web application built to visualize and manage vulnerabilities in software dependencies. This project fetches vulnerability data from a set of JSON files, processes it, and displays it in various charts and cards, including trends, severity breakdowns, and per-file vulnerabilities. The application supports dark mode and provides an interactive UI to explore vulnerable dependencies.

Features
Dark Mode Support: Toggle between light and dark themes.
Vulnerability Overview: Display the total number of critical, high, medium, and low vulnerabilities across all dependencies.
Trend Analysis: Visualize trends in vulnerabilities over time.
Vulnerabilities per File: View a breakdown of vulnerabilities by file.
Interactive Cards: Expandable cards to show detailed information about vulnerable dependencies, including CVE codes and the repositories they are located in.
Sorting and Filtering: Dependencies are sorted by the number of vulnerabilities and severity.
